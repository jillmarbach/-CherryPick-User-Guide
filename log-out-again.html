		<p>I guess, in the end, CherryPick answered all the questions I came to it with. Was I too picky? No, but knowing what I wanted didn&rsquo;t necessarily make it easier to find that. Did dating apps really solve all the problems I had with dating? Of course not, they were just another way to meet people. Could CherryPick help me find my perfect man? The answer was looking more and more like a no.</p>
		<p>I was kind of surprised to realize I was actually okay with that answer. Forcing myself to match and chat with a ton of guys, to go on dates with them and try to make things work because of one shared interest&hellip;that wasn&rsquo;t working for me. It felt like I was putting more energy into maximizing my chances of meeting someone with CherryPick than I was into considering the guys I was meeting. I perfected my profile, created the perfect bunch, and swiped tirelessly through guys. Then, I talked to them for two minutes before making a snap decision about our future. That balance didn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
		<p>I never wanted to feel like I was putting all my effort into trying to meet someone. I would much rather do the things I love&mdash;theatre, school, spending time with my friends&mdash;than try to become what I thought some guy might want. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I was used to falling for so many theatre boys, or why it felt like I was always dating my friends. I connected with people when I was being my most authentic self.</p>
		<p>CherryPick did teach me about dating. It made me think about what I really wanted for myself. I didn&rsquo;t need some perfect guy to flirt with me at a coffee shop or a dude to sweep me off my feet with a novel first date. I wanted to be happy and true to myself, and at the moment, that felt just as achievable on my own as it would with someone else.</p>
		<p>I closed out of CherryPick and pressed down on the app until it was shaking. Then, after considering what I was doing for another minute, I clicked the X. Just like that, CherryPick was gone from my phone forever. Maybe not forever&mdash;I could always download it again in the future, but that seemed like it would be a while from now. For the moment, I didn&rsquo;t need another thing in my life telling me I shouldn&rsquo;t be single.</p>
		<p>It was well past time to get back to experiencing the real world, and I was going to start by going out with my friends.</p>
